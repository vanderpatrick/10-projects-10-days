# 10 Projects in 10 Days

This repository contains 10 projects developed as part of the "10 Projects in 10 Days" challenge.
Honestly i want to code something bigger, but im too dumb and unmotivated to make something big so in order to get a habit im coding 20 - 30 lines of some bullshit to get the hang of it, for example by 1 i got the hang of try and except blocks, like wtf dude that was awesome i always knew wtf they were but like yeah just used for the first time so im happy about it.

## Project 2: number guesser

**Description:**well i wanted to do something whithout any search, i kinda did a little, tried some approuches, but i wasn't pythonic, whitch i belive its supossed to be as simplistic as possible, so yeah something like 30 lines of code it works
